# Text-Detection
This project utilizes OpenCV and EasyOCR for text detection and recognition in images. It reads an image, identifies text, and displays results with bounding boxes and annotations. Users can adjust the confidence threshold for detection, making it versatile for image processing tasks and effective for extracting text from images.
